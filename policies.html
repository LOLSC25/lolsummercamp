            <p>We take a LOT of photos to capture all the fun happening at camp. This summer we will be sharing these photos through 
            the <strong>LOL group chat</strong> and the <strong>FamilyAlbum Photo App</strong>. We will also be using photos for future marketing 
            such as this website.
            
            We do not post any photos of children on social media.
            </p>
    
            <p>
              <strong>Parental Consent:</strong>  
              Every camper must have a signed Photo Release Form on file. No images of your child will be shared publicly without your permission.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Privacy First:</strong>  
              When we share photos, we never share personal details. You’ll see group shots and candid fun—never full names or contact info.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Opt‑Out Anytime:</strong>  
              If you’d rather we keep your camper’s moments just for us, let us know and we’ll happily skip sharing their photos.
